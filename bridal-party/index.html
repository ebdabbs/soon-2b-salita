                        Lizzie has known Emily since the day she was born. Literally. Their top notch April fools pranks,
                        road trip shenanigans, and imaginative games of pretend were the highlights of Lizzie's
                        childhood. As adults, they have grown into each others' confidants and best of friends while maintaining
                        their mischievous synergy. Emily is currently studying visual art at the University of Mary Washington.

                        Amy puts the party in bridal party. As the youngest in the family, Amy is always there to make sure we
                        know what's hip. She knows the ins and outs of the bride &amp; groom's relationship, mostly from spying
                        on them as a kid. She and Lizzie share their love of cats, animation, and a good middle sister joke.
                        Amy is currently a budding artist at Henrico High School's Center for the Arts.

                        they both played clarinet and marched cymbals together. From watching Glee together to many Salita family functions,
                        Helen has felt like a sister to Lizzie for many years. Helen is currently finishing up a dual degree

                        their becoming best buds. When Michael needed a couple to be the cover for the weekend of his
                        proposal to Lizzie, Cody was the man he turned to. Cody attended Longwood University and is currently
                        working in northern Virginia.

                        to high school beach week and beyond, Maddie's sense of humor and friendship have been a constant in
                        Lizzie's life. Maddie attended Clemson University and is currently a nurse in Cleveland, Ohio.

                        Sydney has been one of Michael's best friends on the soccer field to the golf course and on to the

                        heard of "Michael S" from her church. Meredith has been a consistent friend and support through their
                        entire relationship, and we look forward to her continued loving presence! Meredith attended the

                        on the circle. Thomas currently works in Richmond, and as he was a photography major at
                        Hampden-Sydney, Michael and Lizzie want to pass on a special thanks to Thomas for taking their

                        they might say they completed one another. Their range of crazy nights to dedicated support was most
                        distinctly shown when Skyler flew in from Colorado to be there for Michael and Lizzie's engagement.
                        Skyler studied English at the college and currently works as a consultant in Northern Virginia.
