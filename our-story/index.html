            <h4>Once Upon a Time...</h4>
            <p>
                In the land of Richmond, Virginia, world-renowned actor Michael Salita was cast as King Arthur in a unparalleled cinematic masterpiece -- The Adventures of Camelot. Little did he know, his time on the set with "The Lady of the Lake" would change his life forever. Okay, so maybe it was 2009 and a high school English project, but bear with a little embellishment as we tell our love story in a way that would make Mrs. Ostheimer proud.

                The actor and actress continued to spend time together outside of class after the project ended, and on June 17th, 2009 Michael asked Lizzie to be his girlfriend. Their favorite dates in high school included the Goochland Drive-In theater, improving their famous chocolate-chocolate-chip cookie recipe, dinner at Bertucci's, and concerts at The National. They were both members of the Godwin High School Indoor Drumline and competed together in the 2010 and 2011 seasons. As self-proclaimed nerds, Michael and Lizzie ended up in the same Calculus and Physics classes both junior and senior year which allowed them relationship growth opportunities such as building a mousetrap car and hitting the big screen once again in a music video for the Calculus parody of Ke$ha's "We R Who We R".

                After graduation, Michael and Lizzie took on the challenge of a long-distance relationship. Michael attended Hampden-Sydney College, where he majored in Mathematics and minored in Religious Studies and Fine Arts. He was a member of the Hampden-Sydney Acousticals a cappella group, President of the Outsiders Club, and was head coach for the Randolph-Henry High School varsity soccer team. Lizzie attended the College of William and Mary, where she majored in Computer Science and minored in Art. She was an orientation aid, service trip leader for Catholic Campus Ministry, and served as the President of Gamma Phi Beta sorority. They were both inducted into the Omicron Delta Kappa leadership honor society. The two enjoyed visiting each other's schools and attending the Hampden-Sydney winter ball and sorority date functions at William and Mary.

                As they moved through senior year, Michael and Lizzie began looking for jobs in their respective fields.  They searched high and low, and in the end came to accept jobs that would prolong their long-distance relationship for another year. Lizzie moved to Washington, D.C. to work for Booz Allen Hamilton, and Michael moved to West Palm Beach to work for Intech Investment Management. Though they would be far apart, going to see one another every month brought them closer together than ever. Lizzie got to take monthly vacations to the beach and Michael had the opportunity to really explore the nation’s capital and spend time with friends and family from back home.  As they visited one another, they realized that the time for long distance had run its course, and they were ready to take the next step.

                On January 29th, 2016 Lizzie picked Michael up from the airport, excited for a weekend of skiing at Wintergreen Resort with their friends Cody and Emily. Little did she know, Michael had been plotting a proposal since December. After dinner at the Copper Mine Bistro, they walked out on the mountain to see the slopes at night. Cody “forgot his glasses”, leaving the two alone. After snatching Lizzie’s leftovers from her hands and throwing them to the ground, Michael began to tell Lizzie how he wanted their relationship to continue for the rest of their lives. He got down on one knee in the snow, and pulled out the one-of-a-kind diamond ring he had helped to design. And the rest is history…

                But wait! There’s more! After she said yes, they rejoined Cody and Emily to drive back to the house, suspiciously stalling the whole way. They finally returned to an unusually crowded cul-de-sac, and Lizzie opened the door to… attack of the nerf guns! Michael had gathered their high school friends, her sorority sisters, and their roommates to celebrate Richmond style - including a feast of Shyndigz cake, Ukrop’s White House Rolls & Rainbow cookies, and Chick-fil-a. After a weekend of skiing and tubing, they met their families in Richmond for the conclusion of the best #eWeekend ever.
